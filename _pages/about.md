I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at University of Pennsylvania, working with <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8939931"> Prof. Qi Long</a> and <a href='http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~suw/'>Prof. Weijie Su</a>.
I obtained my Ph.D. in statistics from  <a href='http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/'>School of Mathematical Sciences</a>, <a href='https://english.pku.edu.cn/'>Peking University</a> in 2023, advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/zhzhang/" target="_blank">Zhihua Zhang</a>.

My research interests center around the intersection of statistics, stochastic optimization, and machine learning. During my Ph.D., I conducted research in areas such as federated learning, stochastic approximation, online decision making, and online statistical inference. 

More recently, my focus has shifted toward large language models, where I study statistical questions—such as detection, inference, and robustness—while treating the models as black boxes without relying on their internal parameters or architecture.

I will be on the job market in the 2025–2026 cycle, mainly considering academic opportunities, with an interest in scientific research roles if pursuing positions in industry.
