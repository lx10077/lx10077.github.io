I obtained my Ph.D. degree at <a href='http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/'>School of Mathematical Sciences</a>, <a href='https://english.pku.edu.cn/'>Peking University</a> in 2023, advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/zhzhang/" target="_blank">Zhihua Zhang</a>.

My research interests focus on the intersection between theoretical statistics, stochastic optimization, and machine learning.
My general research aims to propose computationally efficient algorithms for structural problems with provable guarantees from both non-asymptotic and asymptotic perspectives.

The fields I worked in include
- Stochastic approximation 
- Online statistical inference
- Online decision making
- Federated learning
